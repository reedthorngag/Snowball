            <h2 class="title">Rust sucks!!!!!</h2>
            <p class="text">Rust is the programming language equivalent of being micromanaged by an overzealous boss who doesn't trust you to do anything without five layers of bureaucracy. Every time you try to write what should be a simple function, the compiler slaps your hand like an angry schoolteacher yelling, "Lifetime annotations!" And heaven forbid you try to do something as daring as shared mutability—boom, welcome to the borrow checker’s dungeon. Yes, memory safety is important, but Rust achieves it by holding developers hostage with arcane syntax and hours of Stack Overflow searches just to move a variable. It’s like building a spaceship when you just needed a bike.</p>

            <h2 class="title">I WISH I FOUND RUST SOONER!!!</h2>
            <p class="text">I just discovered Rust, and I honestly can’t believe I didn’t find it sooner. Compared to other languages I’ve used—Python, JavaScript, even C++—Rust feels like a breath of fresh, logically-structured air. It gives me low-level control without the constant fear of memory bugs, and the compiler? Yeah, it’s strict, but it wants you to succeed. I used to accept crashes and weird runtime issues as “just part of programming,” but Rust showed me that safety and speed don’t have to be trade-offs. And the tooling—Cargo, rustfmt, clippy—it all just works. I feel like I’ve been coding with training wheels, and now I’ve finally touched the real thing.</p>
